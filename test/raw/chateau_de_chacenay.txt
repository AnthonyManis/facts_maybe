==History==
Recorded since 1075, it was the [[fief]] of numerous great families over the years. Construction of the castle began in the 13th century.<ref name=MinCult/> The armoury room contains stone gargoyles that were carved by the same architect who carved the famous gargoyles of Notre Dame.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Sited at the heart of a forest, in the [[Middle Ages]] it formed an impregnable fortress thanks to its ramparts, [[keep]] (now destroyed), ditches, drawbridge and towers. It was the meeting grounds for one of many of the crusades that happened throughout Europe.{{cn|date=July 2014}}  

Damaged following the orders of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], it was over time reconstructed, and destroyed by fire during the [[French Revolution]].
